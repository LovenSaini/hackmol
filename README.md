In this project which we have made for the food wastage we have provided the way for the volunteer as well as for the donor to connect with each other and co-ordinatate to provide the food which was going to waste to the people who really need it.

In this project we have considered three types of wastes-1 which is made in extra quantity
                                                         2 food which was left over by the students
                                                         3 wastage of vegetables as well as the other eatables

So in first step a mess commitee which is formed by the hostel staff will register as donor in the plateitforward website and they will provide the location so that the ngo or any volunteer who is nearby them can coordinate with them and can collect the food from them. 

Any volunteer who want to help should also register in the website so that website can access the location distance between the donor and the volunteer and provide them with the best results 

now the volunteer can donate the food according to their capacity 

All type of waste can be use for different purposes 

IN FUTURE WE CAN DEVELOP THIS WEBSITE TO A LARGER LEVEL AND CAN USE IT NOT ONLY FOR THE COLLEGE MESS BUT ALSO FOR THE RESTRAURANT INDUSTRY WE WILL BE A GREAT STEP TOWARDS OUR MAJOR GOAL : FIGHT HUNGER
